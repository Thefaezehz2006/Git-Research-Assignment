A fork is creating a complete and independent copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. 
It is commonly used to contribute to open-source projects when you don't have direct write access.
The fork copies all files and commit history, but not issues or previous pull requests. You can then make changes and propose them back via a Pull Request.
